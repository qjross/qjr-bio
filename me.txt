I'm Quinten Ross, and I am somehow 30 years old. I don't feel it, however.
My favorite sports teams include the Montreal Canadiens, Charlotte Hornets, Arizona Diamondbacks, Seattle Seahawks, and Seattle Sounders.
My favorite sports related memory.. the easiest two would be the 2001 World Series and Super Bowl 48. However, an underrated one is the 2012-13 college basketball season, complete with 16-team Atlantic 10.
If I had to choose a favorite recent Pokemon, it would have to be either Mimikyu or Togedemaru.
Least favorite Pokemon? I really don't like to really say it, but I don't really like Lurantis that much. The totem battle in Sun and Moon was a pain, and not in a good way.
