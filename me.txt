I'm Quinten Ross, and I do not feel like I'm 30 at all; I feel like I'm still stuck in 2011.
My favorite sports teams include the Montreal Canadiens, Charlotte Hornets, Arizona Diamondbacks, Seattle Seahawks, and Seattle Sounders.
My favorite video game of all time is a bit difficult to decide. It's a tie between Mortal Kombat 2, Saints Row 2, Uncharted 2, and MVP Baseball 2005.
If I had to choose a favorite recent Pokemon, it would have to be Mimikyu, full stop.
