I'm Quinten Ross, and I do not feel like I'm 30 at all; I mentally feel like I should be 22 and back at UNC Charlotte.
My favorite sports teams include the Montreal Canadiens, Charlotte Hornets, Arizona Diamondbacks, Seattle Seahawks, and Seattle Sounders.
My favorite sports related memory.. the easiest two would be the 2001 World Series and Super Bowl 48. However, an underrated one is the 2012-13 college basketball season, complete with 16-team Atlantic 10.
If I had to choose a favorite recent Pokemon, it would have to be either Mimikyu or Togedemaru.
