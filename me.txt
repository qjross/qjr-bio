I'm Quinten Ross, and I'm still reeling over turning 30 just a little over two months ago.
My favorite sports teams include the Montreal Canadiens, Charlotte Hornets, Arizona Diamondbacks, Seattle Seahawks, and Seattle Sounders.
My favorite video game of all time is a bit difficult to decide. It's a tie between Mortal Kombat 2, Saints Row 2, Uncharted 2, and MVP Baseball 2005.
